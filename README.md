# Command Line Projects
A series of command line projects using concepts learned in the first week of the Tech Elevator boot camp.

## Project Details
* Tip Calculator: user enters in their total bill amount and rates their service; program writes to the console what their tip amount should be.
* Simple Math: user enter in two sets of numbers; prompted to add or subtract numbers; program writes to the console the sum or difference.
* Area of Circle: user enters in a series of numbers, program writes to the console the radius of the circle and the area.
* Mad Lib: user enters in parts of speech that the program prompts them and the program writes to the console a funny story based on their inputs. User inputs are capitalized.
* Get Average: user enters in a series of numbers and the program writes to the console the average of the numbers.

## Technology and Language Used
* [C#](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/welcome)
* [Visual Studio 2017](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/whatsnew/)

## Motivation
* It was after my first week of the Tech Elevator bootcamp and I was excited to apply what I learned in the form of these basic command line applications. It gave me a chance to learn more about Visual Studio 2017 and I got more practice with C# over the weekend.
